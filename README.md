Second "attempt" at this on my second go around 2 years later. No coding in-between. This is different.

Didn't go very smoothly. Initial upload with most of features from official google homepage. Functionality not present. Layout on screen is what I aimed for it to be, however code is messy and needs to be tweaked. Overall pleased with this submission for the time being with <1 week of learning. 
Need to add search bar icons, change text colour/size.
